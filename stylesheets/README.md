<h2 align="center">the digital visitors log of the web</h2>

#### Who made VISITORIALS?
VISITORIALS was designed and developed by me, Cedric.
#### What is VISITORIALS?
This is a website where anyone from anywhere can add a digital record of their presence when they visit this site.

#### When was VISITORIALS created?
I started this project during my winter break - Jan. 2017.

#### Why?
The initial idea for this project came from seeing visitor logs at tourist spots. These logs usually ask you for your name, location, and a message and are a fun way to see who has visited that particular location before you. Thus, I wanted to create a similar "log" for the Internet. There are a few other reasons for making creating this website:

* Wanted to stay busy and be productive while away for school
* Wanted to challenge myself by creating something different than I've made before
  * Once this is finished, the website will be interactive as opposed to my previously-created static websites
  * Will also be using JavaScript to dynamically alter the website, something I've had to learn on the fly
* Wanted to get back into web development after only programming in C++ for the last few months

## Future Developments:
- [ ] "log" page where people's records have been submitted
- [ ] mobile/responsive web design (will be using Skeleton CSS)
- [ ] API-implementation for alternating homescreen image
- [ ] back-end work and creation of a database to store records permanently
- [ ] anything else the community would like to see!
